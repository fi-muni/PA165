## Seminar Git & Maven - Solution

**Task 01 (Git)**
Your first task is to setup SSH access to Github, fork PA165 project and clone the forked repository to your environment.
1. Generate your personal SSH key (https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#platform-linux)
2. Add your new SSH key to Github account (https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)
3. Click "Fork" button in top right corner and fork the original repository under your account.
4. Copy link from "Clone or download" popup (choose use SSH) and clone the repository to your local environment by: `git clone git@github.com:<repository_name>/PA165.git <directory_name>`
5. After all you should be able to setup your local repository to use original PA165 project for pull 
and your forked project for push (https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/).

**Task 02 (Git/Maven)**
Switch to **seminar-git-mvn** branch by executing `git checkout -b seminar-git-mvn origin/seminar-git-mvn`. Note that your are working with 2 remotes and 
therefore it's important to explicitly mention origin.
Try to build your project using `mvn install`, it should fail because source files contain lambda calls. Fix the `maven.compiler` settings in parent project 
and rebuild it. Ignore failing tests for now.
Import project **git-mvn-seminar** into your IDE along with its modules.
Check .gitignore file to avoid pushing class files and jar files into repository - modify it if necessary.
Commit changes into **seminar-git-mvn** branch.
```
git add .
git commit -m "My commit description"
```

**Task 03 (Git)**
Create new feature branch called **git-mvn-feature** from **seminar-git-mvn** and checkout it by `git checkout -b git-mvn-feature`. Push your branch to 
remote repository (add remote-tracking by `git push origin git-mvn-feature`). 
Change junit version to 4.11, fix any test which is still failing. Fix can be done in service itself - just follow the contract.
Uncomment method `sellCar(Car car)` in `CarShopStorageService` and create its implementation based on its contract. 
Stage all new and modified files and commit all changes to **git-mvn-feature** (local repository).
```
git add .
git commit -m "My commit description"
```

**Task 04 (Git/Maven)**
Switch to **seminar-git-mvn** branch by `git checkout seminar-git-mvn` and change junit version to 4.12 and uncomment `CarShopStorageServiceTest::testPriceCantBeNegative` for 
JUnit 4.12 (comment out 4.11 part). Verify that test is compilable (that it uses new JUnit version).
Commit and push your changes.
```
git add .
git commit -m "My commit description"
git push origin
```

**Task 05 (Git)**
Switch to feature branch by `git checkout git-mvn-feature` and rebase it on **seminar-git-mvn** branch by `git rebase seminar-git-mvn`.
Resolve your conflicts (keep higher version), stage resolved files by `git add <resolved_filename>` and continue rebase operation by `git rebase --continue`.
Push your changes to remote repository by `git push origin`
Merge **git-mvn-feature** branch to **seminar-git-mvn**. It should be Fast-forward merge.
```
git checkout seminar-git-mvn
git merge git-mvn-feature
```

**Task 06 (Git)**
Since your feature is complete and merged into **seminar-git-mvn**, add tag (v1.0_feature) to mark current version as version with completed 
feature.
```
git tag -a v1.0_feature -m "My tag message"
git push origin v1.0_feature
```

**Task 07 (Git/Maven)**
Update project version to 0.0.2-SNAPSHOT and commit the change.
Then, push all the changes and tags into remote repository (check on github that tag exists and try to use tags to navigate between different versions).
```
git add .
git commit -m "My commit description"
git push origin
```

**Task 08 (Git)**
Remove no longer used branch from both local and remote repository.
```
git branch -d git-mvn-feature
git push origin --delete git-mvn-feature
```

**Task 09 (Maven)**
Configure the project to use jacoco maven plugin (https://www.petrikainulainen.net/programming/maven/creating-code-coverage-reports-for-unit-and-integration-tests-with-the-jacoco-maven-plugin/, you can skip integration tests). It is used for generating test coverage reports.
Remember that any configuration and versioning should be kept in parent pom.xml and the actual usage of plugin should be specified within the project. After you run `mvn (clean) test`, you should find report under target/site directory of car-shop project. Do you understand difference between pluginManagement and plugins? Do you get idea what executions are for? Ask you seminar tutor in case you don't.
Find what part of CarShopStorageService is not covered by tests and write corresponding test to ensure full coverage.

**Task 10 (Maven)**
Configure maven profile called test-coverage for jacoco execution so it isn't executed by default (run by `mvn install -P test-coverage`). Profiles are handy in case you have long taking operations as part of your build and you want to execute them only under certain circumstances (eg. nightly builds).

--------------
Extra tasks in case you still have time.

**Extra Task 01 (Git)**
Modify a code in **seminar-git-mvn** branch and try to revert it in your working copy using git.

**Extra Task 02 (Git)**
Modify code in **seminar-git-mvn** branch, commit your change. Revert your change in repository.

**Extra Task 03 (Git)**
Make several adjustments to code, each with different commit. Cleanup your code into single commit before pushing it to remote repository.

**Extra Task 04 (Git)**
Learn about stashing, figure out how you could use it in your daily work.

**Extra Task 05 (Maven)**
Learn more about lifecycles, try to implement your own lifecycle.

**Extra Task 06 (Maven) - Quiz**
What could happen if you don't follow standardized mvn directory structure?
Why is it important to put all built artifacts into target folder?
What are differences between different dependency scopes?
